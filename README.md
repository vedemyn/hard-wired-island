Hard Wired Island TTRPG System for FoundryVTT

## Description
This is the beginnings of a system for the TTRPG Hard Wired Island (availiable at https://ettin.itch.io/hard-wired-island)

It is currently in a state where it is usable, but not beautiful 

## Installation
The system is compatible with FoundryVTT Version 0.8.0 upwards. 

You can install it using the following link:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vedemyn/hard-wired-island/master/system.json

Simply go to the "Game Systems" tab, click the "Install System" button, paste the URL above into the "Manifest URL" field and click "Install". 

At some point it will also hopefully be released as a package for foundry, enabling you to simply select it from a menu. 

## TODO
- CSS for everything basically.
- Initiative popup.
- Automation of some things such as saves, applying specialties etc. Currently you have to enter things by hand that could be pre-filled on clicking the right things. 
- Possibly pre-filling some of the origins, assets and other things. This depends on permission by the RPG creators and me figuring out what Foundry wants for legal stuff. 
- NPC sheets
- Instead of just having everything be in english by default and calling that "English Localization" maybe add actual entries to the english localization :)
